      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        The passion to create and innovate has always been a part of who I am. I
        believe my interest in web development started back in grade 7 (2012)
        when I learned how to edit my Tumblr theme using HTML and CSS. I've
        always had an interest in technology ever since I was young. I hope to
        be able to build web applications that can improve people's lives.

        When I’m not working or studying, you can find me ice or roller skating
        (depending on the season), discovering new food spots, or catching up on
        some anime.
